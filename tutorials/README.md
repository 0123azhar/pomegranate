# Tutorials

Here are usage tutorials for each of the major modules. This is currently under development, so please let me if you found an example unclear, or even if you found an example particularly illuminating! While hidden Markov models remain the flagship implementation of this module, I hope to have complex use cases for the other modules in the coming months.

To read a tutorial, just click on the notebook above. Github can render IPython notebooks natively, so you don't need to go through the complicated procedure of rendering them somewhere else.
